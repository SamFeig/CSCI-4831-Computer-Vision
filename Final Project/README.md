There are few portions of our project which implement and use third party code. In sections where this is the case, we have added comments linking to the referenced material. Our write-up will specify in more detail the sources, and exactly how they were used. A few of the important sources used in our code are listed below as well:

* As part of our object detection logic, we used pretrained [MobileNet-SSD model and prototext files](https://github.com/chuanqi305/MobileNet-SSD) to initialize our Caffe neural network, and the model used was developed by Google reasearchers for efficient object detection (Paper: [Howard et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861)).
* The [PySimpleGUI demo programs](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/blob/master/DemoPrograms) were referenced in building some of the GUI functionality, namely the Image Viewer.
